Interrupt Handling for a 5-way Joystick by implementing low-level interrupt handlers 
Used Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (NVIC) functions to set and enable interrupts

Tools used-
STM32 Nucleo F401RE development board, with Arm Cortex-M4 RISC CPU
Keil Î¼Vision IDE
Arm mbed application shield
Interrupt requests from joystick are handled by code to change colors of LED on an mbed application shield
